# ETH Price Prediction using XGBoost

This repository contains code for predicting the price of Ethereum (ETH) using XGBoost, a popular machine learning algorithm known for its performance in regression tasks.

## Overview

The project aims to predict the price of Ethereum based on historical data using the XGBoost algorithm. It includes data preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation, and deployment (optional).

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of historical Ethereum price data fetched from yfinance. It typically includes features like:
- Date/time of observation
- Opening price
- Closing price
- High and low prices
- Trading volume
- Additional relevant metrics (calculated from the OHLC data)

## Requirements

To run the code, you need Python installed on your machine along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- yfinance
- statsmodels

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost yfinance statsmodels

```
